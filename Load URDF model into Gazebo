Load URDF model into Gazebo 

The error message you're encountering indicates that the Gazebo ROS factory service is not available. This typically means one of two things:

1. **Gazebo is not running**:
   Ensure that Gazebo is running before you attempt to spawn your entity. You should launch Gazebo with ROS 2 integration enabled. If you simply ran `gazebo` in the terminal, that might not be sufficient. Instead, you should start it with the appropriate ROS 2 launch command to ensure the ROS 2 interfaces are loaded.

2. **ROS 2 Gazebo Plugin is not loaded**:
   If Gazebo was not started with the Gazebo ROS packages, it would not have the necessary services to spawn a model from a URDF file. To start Gazebo with the Gazebo ROS factory plugin, you should use a launch file that includes this plugin, or manually include the plugin in your Gazebo world file.

Hereâ€™s what you can do to troubleshoot:

1. **Check if Gazebo ROS is installed**:
   Make sure the gazebo_ros_pkgs are installed. If they are not, you can install them using the package manager.

2. **Ensure Gazebo is started with ROS integration**:
   To ensure that Gazebo starts with ROS integration, use the `ros2 launch` command with a proper launch file:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py
   ```
   This will start Gazebo with ROS 2 support and the necessary services available.

3. **Retry Spawning the Model**:
   After Gazebo is up and running with ROS 2 support, try the spawn_entity command again:
   ```bash
   ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -file /home/florin/ros2_ws2/src/pkg_1/urdf/my_robot.urdf -entity my_robot
   ```

Make sure to run these commands in separate terminals or background the Gazebo process so it doesn't block your terminal. If you still face issues, it might be helpful to review the Gazebo logs for more detailed error messages, and also ensure that your ROS 2 workspace is properly sourced in each terminal.
