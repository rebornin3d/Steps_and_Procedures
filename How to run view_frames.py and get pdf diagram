How to run view_frames.py

The error "No executable found" suggests that either `tf2_tools` is not correctly installed, or the way you're trying to run `view_frames.py` is not compatible with how executables are organized in ROS 2.

In ROS 2, Python scripts are not directly executable via `ros2 run` like they were in ROS 1. Instead, they need to be installed as entry points in `setup.py` of their respective package. This might be the case with `view_frames.py`.

Here's what you can do:

1. **Verify Installation**: First, ensure that `tf2_tools` is correctly installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-iron-tf2-tools
   ```

2. **Source ROS 2 Environment**: Make sure your ROS 2 environment is sourced:
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash
   ```

3. **Check for the Script**: Verify that `view_frames.py` exists in your ROS 2 installation:
   ```bash
   find /opt/ros/iron -name view_frames.py
   ```

4. **Run the Script Directly**: If you find the script, you might need to run it directly with Python, for example:
   ```bash
   python3 /path/to/view_frames.py
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path where `view_frames.py` is located.

5. **Check for Updates or Issues**: Sometimes, these kinds of issues are known and might have been addressed in updates or discussed in community forums or the ROS 2 documentation.

6. **Alternative Approach**: If `view_frames.py` is not designed as an executable in ROS 2, you might need to look for alternative ways to visualize TF frames in ROS 2, possibly using different tools or commands.

Remember, the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2 involves significant changes in how packages and nodes are structured and run, so some tools and scripts might need to be used differently.
