Convert multiple Xacro files to URDF and load them in Gazebo, follow these steps:

1. **Convert Multiple Xacro Files to URDF**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing your Xacro files.
    - Use a loop in the terminal to convert each Xacro file. For example, in a Bash shell, you can use:
      ```bash
      for file in *.xacro; do
          rosrun xacro xacro.py $file > ${file%.xacro}.urdf
      done
      ```
    This command converts all `.xacro` files in the folder to `.urdf` files.

2. **Combining Multiple URDF Files**:
    - Typically, each robot or model in Gazebo is represented by a single URDF file.
    - If your model is split across multiple URDF files, you might need to combine them into one. This can be done by including smaller URDF files into a main URDF file using the `<include>` tag or by manually merging them, ensuring the joint connections and links are correctly configured.

3. **Loading URDF in Gazebo**:
    - Once you have a single URDF file representing your model, you can load it into Gazebo.
    - Create a ROS launch file that includes your URDF and specifies the Gazebo world settings.
    - Use a command like `roslaunch your_package your_launch_file.launch` to start Gazebo with your model loaded.

4. **Considerations for Multiple URDFs**:
    - If your project is designed to use multiple URDF files simultaneously (like modular robots), each URDF will represent a different part or module of the robot.
    - In such cases, ensure that the connections between different URDFs (like joints and links) are properly defined in your ROS environment.
    - You might need to use advanced techniques to simulate interactions between these different URDF components in Gazebo.
