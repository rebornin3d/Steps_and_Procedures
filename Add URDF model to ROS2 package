Add URDF model to ROS2 package

To add a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) model of a robot to your ROS 2 package in the `src` folder, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a URDF Directory**: Create a directory within your ROS 2 package to store the URDF model files. You can name this directory something like `urdf`. You can do this using the terminal:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/ros2_ws2/src/pkg_1/urdf
   ```

2. **Create a URDF File**: Within the `urdf` directory, create a URDF file that describes your robot's structure. You can use a text editor to create this file, and it should have the `.urdf` extension. Here's an example of how to create a simple URDF file:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <robot name="my_robot">
     <link name="base_link">
       <visual>
         <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
         <geometry>
           <box size="0.1 0.1 0.1"/>
         </geometry>
       </visual>
     </link>
   </robot>
   ```

   This example describes a robot with a single box-shaped link named `base_link`.

3. **Add Meshes and Textures (Optional)**: If your robot model includes meshes or textures, place them in the `urdf` directory as well. Be sure to reference these files correctly in your URDF file.

4. **Edit `CMakeLists.txt`**: Open the `CMakeLists.txt` file of your ROS 2 package located in the package's root directory (e.g., `~/ros2_ws2/src/pkg_1`). Add the following lines to the `CMakeLists.txt` file to specify the installation of URDF files:

   ```cmake
   install(DIRECTORY urdf
     DESTINATION share/${PROJECT_NAME}/
   )
   ```

   This code instructs ROS 2 to install the contents of the `urdf` directory when the package is built and installed.

5. **Build Your ROS 2 Package**: Go to the root of your ROS 2 workspace (`~/ros2_ws2`) and build the package:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws2
   colcon build
   ```

6. **Source Your Workspace**: Source your workspace to set up the environment:

   ```bash
   source ~/ros2_ws2/install/setup.bash
   ```

7. **Verify URDF Installation**: You can check if the URDF files from your package have been installed by using the `rospack` command:

   ```bash
   rospack find <package_name>
   ```

   Replace `<package_name>` with the name of your ROS 2 package (e.g., `pkg_1`). This command should show the path to your package's installation directory, and the URDF files should be located within the `share/<package_name>/urdf` directory.

With these steps, you've added a URDF model to your ROS 2 package. You can now use this URDF model for simulation or visualization purposes, such as in Gazebo or RViz.
