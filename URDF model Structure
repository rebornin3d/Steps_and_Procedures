URDF model Structure

A URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) model in ROS can be composed of varying numbers of files, depending on the complexity of the robot. At its simplest, a URDF model can be a single XML file describing the robot's joints, links, sensors, and actuators. However, for more complex robots, the URDF model might be composed of several files:

1. **Main URDF File**: Contains the overall structure of the robot, including links and joints.

2. **Xacro Files**: These are XML Macro files used to simplify the URDF creation process. They allow for more modular and reusable code.

3. **Mesh Files**: These are used for visual representation of the robot's parts. They are often in formats like STL or COLLADA.

4. **Configuration Files**: For sensors, actuators, and other components, additional YAML or XML configuration files might be used.

5. **Launch Files**: Although not part of the URDF itself, launch files are often used in conjunction with URDF to launch the robot model in ROS environments like Rviz or Gazebo.

The number of files can vary widely from a simple, single-file model to a complex one with dozens of files.
